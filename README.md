Which programming language and version did you pick?

  I chose to use Ruby for this assignment

Why did you pick this programming language?

  I chose Ruby because it seemed like a good language to use for an assignment like this. It has very strong support for object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms. Classes and objects are basically fundamental in Ruby so this assignment seemed very fitting. Along with its support for regex which was very very helpful. Also Ruby was recommended to me in conversation about this assignment with a coworker.

How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 

  As Ruby is very OOP focused. It handles all of these things very well. It has multiple file ingestion methods, but for this assignment I only used the methods related to CSV ingestion in the csv library. Conditionals in Ruby are very typical just having typical if, else, if else, statments. It also has support for unless statments which are very helpful for compacting code. Assignments in Ruby are much like python where you do not need to assign a variable type and type conversion is very good so that is not a concern. Loops in Ruby are also very typical. It has for loops while loops and each loops which are a bit less typical but are essentially just auto iterrating for loops with a fancy name. Ruby has support for both typical functions and methods inside classes and can be called on objects. Ruby includes libraries like RSpec, Minitest, and Test::Unit for unit testing. These enable developers to write robust test suites to ensure code reliability. Ruby provides a built-in mechanism for exception handling using begin, rescue, ensure, and raise, ensuring graceful error handling.

List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.

  I ended up using the 'csv' library for pulling in the csv neatly and I used the 'minitest/autorun' library for quick unit testing. Those were the only libraries I used.
